Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms.

# Symmetrical Cipher
Image-based symmetrical encryption algorithm. To run python file, pillow must be installed. Type ```pip install pillow``` into shell.

# RSA
Asymmetrical encryption algorithm. Can only encode small files (up to 1024 bytes). I'm not making the private key public.
